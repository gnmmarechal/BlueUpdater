# BlueUpdater
Updater for Luma3DS CFW. Based on StarUpdater and Corbenik CFW Updater: RE.


BlueUpdater is essentially a mix between StarUpdater by @astronautlevel2 and my own Corbenik CFW Updater: RE.
It was also built to be the base for PumaUpdater and LimaUpdater, which update Puma33DS CFW and Lima3DS+LimaCFW.

Its UI is based on that of EasyRPG Updater: RE (which is the base for all of my updater projects as far as UI goes).
It also behaves like Corbenik CFW Updater: RE in the way that it uses a bootstrapper to boot the latest main script (to make it unnecessary to update in most cases).



##Credits
- me (gnmmarechal/gnmpolicemata), obviously, for the updater, bootstrapper script and UI
- @Rinnegatamante for Lua Player Plus 3DS, help with Lua, and for porting EasyRPG, which made me make an updater in the first place
- @chaoskagami for Corbenik CFW, which made me decide to adapt EasyRPG's updater and make it simpler for Corbenik Updater
- @astronautlevel2 for a lot of the important code for Luma3DS from StarUpdater(like getting the version, patching path, etc.), as well as having a public Luma build server
